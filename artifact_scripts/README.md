This folder contains all the scripts needed to run the experiments present in the main body of the paper.

We provide three shortcuts to execute the main findings of the paper:

- ```eurosys_quick.sh``` which runs quickly (less than 1 hour) and generates plot X,Y.
- ```eurosys_medium.sh``` which runs slower (around 4-6 hours) and generates plot X,Y.
- ```eurosys_full.sh ``` which runs all the experiments of the paper but takes very long (potentially up to a day).

Exact running times depend on HW performance.
